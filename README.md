# my-web-site

My v2 of me website. 

The v1 was made using VueJs. Due to not do frequent editing i made the choice to 
make a simple html page. And because i was not able to start my old vueJs project due to
incompatible/deprecated stuff... A try to update it, but there was error of deprecated thing.

So, simple html and css, js will never deprecated like a js framework.

So there we are. I have taken the html output of my current live website and
ajuste the html and the css and js.

My take away here is its not wort it to use javascript framework for simple
website.
